# Project: Unit Converter
### About:
When you travel, everything changes: people, languages, time zones and even units. It may be difficult to get used to Fahrenheit when you use Celsius, or measure yourself in kilos if you only used pounds before. Not an easy matter, but a nice unit converter might help! In this project, you will write a converter that handles distance, weight and temperature units: all the traveller’s essentials.
### Learning outcomes:
Get comfortable with the basics: loops, conditions and data input/output.
### This project is a part of the following learning goals:
Kotlin Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/5: Standard output
Display simple conversion examples: for instance, a standard measurement table.
### Stage 2/5: Let's get metric
Teach your program to convert kilometers to meters.
### Stage 3/5: Distances
Teach your program to handle other distance units - yards, feet and inches - and convert them to meters.
### Stage 4/5: Heavy duty
Now you can convert all distance units; time to enable your converter to work with weight measure units as well.
### Stage 5/5: Is it getting hot here?
Your converter is only missing one thing: temperatures. Teach it to convert Fahrenheir, Celsius and Kelvin, and your ultimate unit converter is ready.
