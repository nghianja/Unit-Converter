<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you will write a program that can convert a value with any measure of length from the list below, using the metric system.</p>

<p>The conversion should follow these rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>One meter should, of course, consist of 1 meter.</li>
  <li>One kilometer should consist of 1000 meters.</li>
  <li>One centimeter should consist of 0.01 meters.</li>
  <li>One millimeter should consist of 0.001 meters.</li>
  <li>One mile should consist of 1609.35 meters.</li>
  <li>One yard should consist of 0.9144 meters.</li>
  <li>One foot should consist of 0.3048 meters.</li>
  <li>One inch should consist of 0.0254 meters.</li>
</ol>

<p>The user should input a number and a type of measurement. These types of measurements should be allowed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For meters, the user can input "m", "meter", or "meters".</li>
  <li>For kilometers, the user can input "km", "kilometer", or "kilometers".</li>
  <li>For centimeters, the user can input "cm", "centimeter", or "centimeters".</li>
  <li>For millimeters, the user can input "mm", "millimeter", or "millimeters".</li>
  <li>For miles, the user can input "mi", "mile", or "miles".</li>
  <li>For yards, the user can input "yd", "yard", or "yards".</li>
  <li>For feet, the user can input "ft", "foot", or "feet".</li>
  <li>For inches, the user can input "in", "inch", or "inches".</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, the types of measurement should be case insensitive. That means that "Meters", "METERS", and "mEtErS" should work correctly as well as "meters".</p>

<p>The output should contain full names of measurement types. Also, if the value is 1.0, the name of the measurement type must be singular. For example, "1.0 meter" but "1.1 meters".</p>
